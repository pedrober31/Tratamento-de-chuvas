## Analysis and manipulation of fluviometric data ðŸ’§

Hi there!

The purpose of each code will be listed below

Stations.py: Get the stations affected and not affected by a given dam;

hydrological_signatures: Calculate the hydrological signatures for each station and generate a dataframe from that;

Cluster_KMeans: Group stations based on their signatures due to their hydrological characteristics.
